- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sithlord68. I am a Swiss general IT specialist in my 50ties, who did programming in early jobs (before 2000). I then became an technician, specialized in windows.
- I am now going back to my early interest (developpment), but have a lot to catch.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in particulary: motorcycling, skiing, video gaming
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript with Firebase, wanting to develop my personal project, at last !
